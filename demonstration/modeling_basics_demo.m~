%% Step 1: Question
% 

%% Simulate a tricky coin with varying success rates for varying priors

% Type of prior:
% 1 = uniform
% 2 = weak around p=0.3
% 3 = strong around p=0.5
p = 1; 

% Set up likelihood:
% Binomial distribution with 2 parameters
% n = total number of trials
% k = total number of successes
n = 100; 
k = 65; 

% Simulate tricky coin:
tricky_coin(n,k,p)
